# Hi! I am the file you need

Great! You found a `branch` and saw this file. You will need to copy this file into a Git `branch` in your own repo. But not just yet.

## Steps to branch

1. Go to your private repo on `robots`
2. Follow TA instruction and make a new `branch` named `Phase_1` 
3. You will need to open the `local` repo on your computer
4. On your `local` repo copy (or `clone`), you can add a file called `Phase_1.md` and save it to the repo folder
   - there is no `branch` stuff at this point, just regular file making and regular file saving
   - be sure to copy this file into `Phase_1.md`
5. _Now_ we need `git stuff`: in a `CLI` for `Git` or your using your `GUI` (e.g., `GitHub Desktop`), you will need to switch or `checkout` a `branch`
   - specifically, switch to the branch you made while at the remote repo in Step 2.
   - it could be as simple as `fetch`, `pull`, and then switch to the branch
   - it might be that you have to `git checkout <branch>` (where `branch` is `Phase_1`)
6. You want to `git add` and `git commit` the new `Phase_1.md` file _while on the new branch_
7. You want to `git push` _while on the new branch_
8. Check online at your remote repo that you:
   - have a new branch
   - the file you made is on that branch (and not on the main branch!)
9. You can now answer the following questions either by editing the file locally and pushing the changes or by editing the file online through GitHub's file editor.
10. Please submit your question responses by the end of day today
11. Your GitHub `robots` repo must be updated with the new `branch` before you leave the lab (2pm-3pm)
